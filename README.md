# intro

I write more than I vlog. My friends used to give me static about my 'dear diary' moments at work or whatever. Journaled everything in the startup days. Most of my 'journalling' has moved into Outlook or Tasks or Email now, but I still like to rip out a few pages from time to time.

This repository is in memoriam. Letters I wish I could send to my father. We lost him to COVID last year. I know he's still around, but where he is, the reception isn't great. Well, it was great, but his service is done. Selah.

These are letters I wish I could send him. Instead I'll politely ask my wonderful God to convey the messages, if He wants to. Enjoy, or don't. I'm writing this for me and Dad.
